# Travel Trip - Personalized Itinerary & Travel Information Application

## Introduction
This project was completed as a final graduation project for my Bachelor's degree in Information Management at the National Yunlin University of Science and Technology. The primary objective of this app development is to help individuals in creating their  personalized travel itineraries tailored to their personality, while also enhancing their understanding of the country they are visiting through the travel destinations, events, hotels, and accommodations provided in the app.

## Tools Used
- Flutter
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Android Studio
- OpenAI
- Firebase
- Postman
- MySQL

## Application Features Highlights

**1. Personalized Itinerary:**
- Through the questionnaire given to the users when they first signed up for our apps, we gained data on the users' personalities and with the help of OpenAI we organize and recommend itineraries of the country they want to visit.
- The user can save the itinerary and provide a rating based on the alignment of the destination suggestions with their personality or their desired places to visit.

**2. Destination Information**
-  We provide an introduction to the places or attractions, events, restaurants, hotels, and accommodations of the country. Complete with the description, social media links, open hours, address, and contact number.
- Users can also save these destinations to their favorites page, enabling them to curate a selection of preferred destinations.

**3. Weather Forecast & Rate Conversion**
- To help users gain a better understanding of the places they will visit without leaving the app, we added the weather forecast and rate conversion feature.
- These two features will assist users in preparing the type of items of clothing for the trip as well as the amount of money they should prepare.

**4. Profile Page & Discussion Page**
- Using Instagram and X as our reference, we would like to let users be able to express their feelings through texts and photos. Users can upload their beautiful pictures of the destination they want visit to or have visited before.
- Other users can also like, comment, and share the posts to show their agreement or their own experience as well.<br>

**5. Multilingual Service**
As a lot of countries become more diverse, we realize that the ability to change the language of our application becomes more important. Therefore, we added this feature to help other people from other countries understand the country they are visiting in their language.<br>

## Business Insights

- Aside from developing the application, we also pay attention to the business aspect of this application development. Through the methods of SWOT Analysis and Business Model, we are confident that this app generates revenue not only for internal but also for external communities, especially the locals in each country.
- Through the means of collaboration and sponsorship, we will help the local tour guides, hotels, restaurants, etc, to advertise their restaurant in our application, resulting in an awareness boost of the place.
